Date Released : October 17, 2001
Created By    : Chris Vega [gwapo@models.com]
Application   : FreeWare (Source-Code Included)

To study one File-Format Structure, is a "TRUE" advanced
task for a programmer, offset-by-offset and byte-by-byte
definitions, and studying the Executable Format of the
system you are working on one of this tasks.

But to study a format, you must have a Viewer and a Format
Description itself from the File-Format author/developer
or by scanning through the use of Scanners/Detectors.

Using the FileMapping Class I recently submitted to this
Server, I have created a Portable Executable Viewer, an
Application capable of:

	- Has support for Portable Executable 64-Bit
	- Opening and Detecting Portable Executable Type
	- Recalculating Image Checksum
	- View MS-DOS Compatibility Headers
	- View Portable Executable Headers
	- View Optional Headers
	- Generating a Full Report

** Future Release **

	- Browse to Sections
	- Can Save the Re-Calculated Checksum
	- Modify Sections Characteristics
		- Readable
		- Writable
		- Executable
		- Etch.
	- Browse through Resources
	- Strip Relocations

** Much Future Release **

	- PE Packing, Encrypting
	- Re-Calculate Alignments to Decrease Size
	- Code-Optimizations
	- Decompiler (Generate ASM Codes)

- This project will continue until fully operational
